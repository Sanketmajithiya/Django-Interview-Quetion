# Interview quetions for python basics

# Q-1 if else statement is used when to execute one block of code if condition is true and another is False (conditional statements)
"""
if condition:
    # code to be executed  if the condition is true
else:
    # code to be executed  if the condition is false
         
    
"""
# Q-2 nested if_elif

"""
in python we can use nested if statements or a combination of if,elif and else statements to more descision making structures.    
"""

# Q-3 if elif else lader 
"""
if elif else lader  in python more serise of condition statements used for more complex decision-making

  if condition1:
                #code to be exucute if condition1 is True 
  elif condition2:
                #code to be exucute if condition2 is True(if condition1 is false) 
  elif condition3:
                #code to be exucute if condition3 is True(if both condition1 and condition2 are false) 
                
                # ... you can have more elif blocks as needed
  else:
       #code to be excuted if none  of the conditions are True 
                  
Example easy :-
x = 48


if x > 15:
    print("x is greater than 15")
elif x > 10:
    print("x is greather than 10 but not 15")
elif x > 5:
    print("x is grather than 5 but not 10")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")
